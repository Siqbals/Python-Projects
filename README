Python Truth Table Generator 

Overview:
Given a logic expression consisting of not's and and's, the algorithm can generate a truth table for it 
and output it to a csv file 
the expressions are collected from the exprs.txt file and are outputted to the output.csv file 
  expressions in the exprs.txt file use brackets to seperate sub expressions, the algorithm automatically computes these in order 
currently the algorithm does not support the use of or
